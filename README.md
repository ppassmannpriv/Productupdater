# Productupdater #

### Mage 1.9 ###

---

I'm trying to figure out a neat way to update products with XML and CSV files. In a lot of projects clients want to update this via an extra script or extra file structure etc. So going over their already existing product import is not enough. After a lot of haphazardly updating stuff via custom php code in Helpers or stuff like that, I decided to just write one robust extension and in future projects I will just have to deal with mapping CSV or XML values to certain product attributes.
